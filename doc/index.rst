Welcome to OpenPOWER Firmware's documentation!
==============================================

This documentation is for the ``op-build`` project, which is a buildroot
overlay designed to build a full firmware image for OpenPOWER Systems.
Individual firmware components will have their own documentation, which
we link to where needed, but this document is focused on specifics to
do with building the full firmware image.
