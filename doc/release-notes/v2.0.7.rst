Release Notes for OpenPower Firmware v2.0.7
===========================================

op-build v2.0.6 was released on Friday August 3rd, 2018 and replaces op-build v2.0.6 as the current stable release in
the 2.0.x series.

It is recommended that v2.0.7 be used over any previous v2.0.x version on POWER9 systems due to the bug fixes contained within.

The only update in this release is to skiboot v6.0.7 to work around a hardware errata in the interrupt controller on POWER9.

The bug fix is:

- xive: Disable block tracker

  Due to some HW errata, the block tracking facility (performance
  optimisation for large systems) should be disabled on Nimbus chips.
  Disable it unconditionally for now.
