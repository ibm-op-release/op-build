Subject: [PATCH] Add sync to doorbell function to avoid weak consistency bug

Due to the way POWER works, there is no guarantee that a memory
location written by 1 thread is actually visible to another thread
unless you explicitly assert a sync of some kind.  In the code
that runs to wake up new cores, there is a path where memory
is written by 1 thread (usually on the master processor) but is
immediately consumed by a new thread that just woke up.  It is
possible for the new thread to consume the memory and not see
the contents that were written by the other thread.

The fix is to add a sync command before we send the doorbell
msgsnd operation.  This will ensure the memory contents are
visible to the thread as soon as it wakes up.
